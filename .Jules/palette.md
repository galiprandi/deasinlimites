## 2025-05-15 - [Accessible Pagination]
**Learning:** Disabled interactive elements like pagination arrows should explicitly communicate their state to assistive technologies using `aria-disabled="true"`. This prevents confusion for screen reader users who might encounter the element but not understand why it's not actionable.
**Action:** Added `aria-disabled="true"` to disabled pagination spans in `components/Pagination.tsx`.
## 2025-05-15 - [Search Keyboard Shortcut Discoverability]
**Learning:** Adding a visual shortcut hint (like '/') that disappears on focus or when the input is not empty improves discoverability without cluttering the UI permanently. Using `:not(:placeholder-shown)` is a clean CSS-only way to handle the visibility state based on input content.
**Action:** Always pair global keyboard shortcuts with subtle visual hints to ensure they are discoverable by users who don't read documentation.
## 2025-05-15 - [Persistent Scroll Progress Indicators]
**Learning:** Reading progress bars must initialize their state on mount to handle page reloads or deep-linking to anchors. Without an initial calculation, the bar remains at 0% until the first scroll event, creating a jarring "jump" when the user interacts.
**Action:** Always call the scroll update function immediately within the `useEffect` hook to ensure the UI reflects the current state from the moment it is visible.
