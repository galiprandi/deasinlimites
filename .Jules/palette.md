## 2025-05-15 - [Accessible Pagination]
**Learning:** Disabled interactive elements like pagination arrows should explicitly communicate their state to assistive technologies using `aria-disabled="true"`. This prevents confusion for screen reader users who might encounter the element but not understand why it's not actionable.
**Action:** Added `aria-disabled="true"` to disabled pagination spans in `components/Pagination.tsx`.
## 2025-05-15 - [Search Keyboard Shortcut Discoverability]
**Learning:** Adding a visual shortcut hint (like '/') that disappears on focus or when the input is not empty improves discoverability without cluttering the UI permanently. Using `:not(:placeholder-shown)` is a clean CSS-only way to handle the visibility state based on input content.
**Action:** Always pair global keyboard shortcuts with subtle visual hints to ensure they are discoverable by users who don't read documentation.
## 2025-05-15 - [Refined Search Interaction]
**Learning:** For search inputs, implementing 'Escape' key handling to both clear and blur the field provides a fast 'exit' path for power users. Additionally, ensuring the input regains focus after a 'clear' action maintains flow for keyboard users.
**Action:** Always ensure search inputs have an 'Escape' to exit and that 'clear' buttons return focus to the input.
