## 2025-05-15 - [Accessible Pagination]
**Learning:** Disabled interactive elements like pagination arrows should explicitly communicate their state to assistive technologies using `aria-disabled="true"`. This prevents confusion for screen reader users who might encounter the element but not understand why it's not actionable.
**Action:** Added `aria-disabled="true"` to disabled pagination spans in `components/Pagination.tsx`.
## 2025-05-15 - [Search Keyboard Shortcut Discoverability]
**Learning:** Adding a visual shortcut hint (like '/') that disappears on focus or when the input is not empty improves discoverability without cluttering the UI permanently. Using `:not(:placeholder-shown)` is a clean CSS-only way to handle the visibility state based on input content.
**Action:** Always pair global keyboard shortcuts with subtle visual hints to ensure they are discoverable by users who don't read documentation.
## 2025-05-15 - [Estimated Reading Time]
**Learning:** Providing an estimated reading time sets clear expectations for the user, improving the experience for educational or long-form content. Using a standard words-per-minute heuristic (e.g., 200 wpm) provides a reliable baseline for these calculations.
**Action:** Include reading time estimates for all long-form content to help users manage their time effectively.
